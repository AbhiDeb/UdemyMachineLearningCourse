Catogorical Data
-----------------------------------------------------------

The data in a column which has categories.

Like if in a column the values are Yes/No, it is categorical data as it contains 2 categories,
namely Yes and No.

ML is all about equations. So if some categorical data contains text or something, we have to encode those
data into numbers.

LabelEncoder encodes the value to it's numerical value. Like for France,Germany and Spain it will encode
it to 0,1 and 2 respectively.
This doesn't make sense as it is like giving priroties to these countries. We just want to encode them to 
use it in our equations.

So to solve this we use OneHotEncoder class. It makes x number of columns where x is the number of categories
in that particular catogorical column.
So in each of the column, if a particlar value of category is there, it's value will be 1.
